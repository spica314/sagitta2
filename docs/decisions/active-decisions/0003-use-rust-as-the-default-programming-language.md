### Reasons for Choosing Rust

- Performance: Rust provides low-level control, making it ideal for performance-critical applications.
- Memory Safety: Rust's ownership system prevents common memory-related bugs like null pointer dereferences, buffer overflows, and use-after-free errors.
- Concurrency: Rust's ownership model ensures safe and efficient concurrency, reducing the likelihood of data races in our application.
